"""Shared hermeticity helper: isolate a test from this machine's real ~/.secrets and Infisical.

fleet_rag.core.HANDOFF (~/.secrets/global-api-keys) and fleet_rag.public_fallback's
PUBLIC_ENV_FILES / CF_ACCESS_FILE are all resolved from pathlib.Path.home() at IMPORT time (see
core.py and public_fallback.py), *before* any test's setUp runs.  Patching os.environ["HOME"]
from inside a test therefore does nothing to them -- the real path was already captured.  On a
machine that actually has a populated ~/.secrets/global-api-keys (an owner's Mac, unlike a CI
runner), a test that reaches any of these unpatched attributes will read real credentials and,
if fleet_rag.core.infisical_login() then succeeds, make a real network call to Infisical -- slow,
and a genuine credential leak into the test process.

Use HermeticTestCase as a drop-in base (it cooperates with your own setUp via super()), or mix
HermeticCredentialsMixin into an existing base class and call self.make_hermetic() yourself:

    from fleet_rag.tests._hermetic import HermeticTestCase

    class MyTests(HermeticTestCase):
        def setUp(self):
            super().setUp()   # gets you make_hermetic() for free
            ...

    cd scripts && python3 -m unittest fleet_rag.tests._hermetic -v
