"""Fall back to the public recall.jays.services service when the Tailscale-only Qdrant/TEI
path is unreachable from this Mac.

The Mac-side surfaces (the `recall` CLI and the stdio `fleet-recall-mcp.py`) call
`fleet_rag.recall_api` functions directly against TEI_URL / QDRANT_URL, which are Tailscale
mesh addresses (see docs/RAG-FLEET-INFRA.md).  When Tailscale is down on this Mac -- logged
out, a captive/corporate network blocking the control plane, or simply not running -- every
call to those addresses fails as a connection-level error (refused / reset / timeout).
`core.http_json` retries such an error 4 times with exponential backoff before giving up, so
the failure surfaces slowly and as an opaque `ConnectionError` / `RemoteDisconnected`
traceback.

This module gives those two surfaces a fast, actionable alternative:

  1. A cheap up-front check (`tailscale_status_text`, ~0.1-3s) reads `tailscale status` so an
     already-known-down Tailscale skips the slow local retry storm entirely and goes straight
     to the public path.  A machine with no Tailscale.app (Linux, CI, a relocated binary)
     reports "unknown", which is treated as "assume up" -- this module only ever *skips* the
     local path on positive evidence, never on the absence of the binary.  macOS GUI IPC
     failure is positive evidence: `tailscale status` from a LaunchAgent / no-Aqua session
     tries to start Tailscale.app and returns `CLIError 3` instead of "logged out"; that is
     treated as down so `recall stats` does not wait on private Qdrant's 120s per-call
     timeout.  `RECALL_SKIP_PRIVATE=1` skips the Tailscale binary entirely (no GUI start)
     and skips the private path even when QDRANT_URL/TEI_URL are set.  On macOS, when the
     status check itself is unknown (no Tailscale.app at all), `private_route_bypasses_
     tailscale` reads the OS routing table for the configured Qdrant host as a second,
     independent signal -- a route that resolves to a non-"utun" interface is positive
     evidence the private hop is gone, so the same fast public path is taken instead of
     hanging on this network's transparent TCP proxy until the 120s read timeout.  Both
     signals are combined in `direct_path_blocked`, shared by `call_with_fallback` and
     `recall doctor --platforms`.
  2. Otherwise the local path still runs first -- Tailscale can flap, and "believed up" is a
     hint, not a guarantee -- but a CONNECTION-LEVEL failure from it (never an HTTP 4xx/5xx,
     which is a real answer from a reachable server) is caught and retried once against
     https://recall.jays.services's REST twin (`scripts/fleet-recall-service`).
  3. The public retry needs three names: `RECALL_API_TOKEN` and `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID` /
     `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET` (the Cloudflare Access service token) -- see
     docs/RECALL-ACCESS-CHECK.md.  A value already in the environment wins; otherwise each is
     read straight from its handoff file (PUBLIC_ENV_FILES: RECALL_API_TOKEN from
     ~/.secrets/global-api-keys, the Access pair from
     ~/.secrets/agents-jays-services-access-service-token.env) so this works from the stock
     `python3 fleet-recall-mcp.py` MCP registration with no shell wrapper.  The request also
     carries a real `User-Agent` (core.http_json sends none, and urllib's default trips
     Cloudflare's bot management -- 403, "error code: 1010").  A missing name, or a failure on
     the public path too (a rejected bearer, Access rejecting the service token, the box itself
     down), produces one plain-English, actionable line -- never a second opaque exception.

Only recall_search / recall_stats / recall_contribute are covered (the shared tool contract).
The public service's recall_search route now accepts every recall_search() keyword, including
`per_doc`, `rerank`, and `prefer_lessons` (see `scripts/fleet-recall-service/server.py` TOOLS).
The CLI-only `--force` dedup-guard override has no public twin -- it is silently dropped when a
call actually falls back, and the near-duplicate contribute guard
(a local-only nicety, not part of the shared tool contract) is skipped rather than run against
an unreachable backend.

The Hetzner-side `fleet-recall-service` imports `recall_api` directly and never goes through
this module: it already runs on the box next to Qdrant/TEI and has no Tailscale hop to lose.

Callers must never engage the network path while a test has swapped `recall_api.Qdrant` for
`FakeQdrant` (`recall_api.install_fake_backend()`) -- see `using_fake_backend`.
