"""PreToolUse hook for Bash: hard-enforced backstop under the secret-safety skill.

Reads the hook JSON on stdin, checks tool_input.command against five concrete
patterns that caused real secret exposures:
  A) direct dump of a known secret-bearing file (cat/head/tail/less/more/bat
     and byte-dump tools od/xxd/hexdump/hd/strings/base64)
  B) a Bearer/Authorization value embedded in args with no redaction pipe present
  C) any `ps` invocation at all
  C2) `pgrep -l` / `-fl` / `-lf` (prints argv like ps)
  D) a command that directly references a secrets-bearing path AND merges
     stderr into visible output (2>&1)
  E) byte-dump / prefix-cut / last-command printf of a variable whose name
     looks like a key (KEY, TOKEN, SECRET, PASSWORD, PASSWD, DSN)

All five are hard denies. C started as an "auto-filter the dangerous part, then
allow" rewrite (append `| grep -v -- --mcp-config` to exclude this harness's own
argv-embedded credentials), but that was proven wrong THE SAME NIGHT it was
written: the harness's own argv is one exposure source among several running
MCP-server child processes that ALSO carry credentials directly in their argv
(e.g. `mcp-remote <url> --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"`), and no
single exclusion pattern covers all of them. A filter that misses a case is
worse than no filter, because it creates false confidence that the output was
made safe. `ps` is denied outright; `pgrep`/`pgrep -f`/`pgrep -P` return PIDs
only and cannot leak argv under any flag combination, so they're the correct
tool whenever the actual need is "does this process exist" / "what is its
parent" rather than "show me its full command line."

D exists because of a third incident the same night: after a secret had already
leaked once, the fix attempt was a hand-written `sed` filter for a shell error
message, built reactively under pressure -- and it was written for bash's error
format while the actual shell was zsh, which formats the same error differently.
The filter matched nothing and the same fragment printed again, twice more. The
lesson generalizes past that one regex: capturing stderr (2>&1) from anything
that touches a secrets file is inherently risky, because error messages can
echo back fragments of whatever failed in a shape you can't predict in advance
(a shell's own "command not found: <fragment>" being the exact case here). The
safe pattern is to redirect stderr to /dev/null or a file and check the exit
code alone, never to capture-and-filter it in the same command.

E exists because of 2026-09-17: a subagent loaded SILICONFLOW_API_KEY from the
handoff file correctly (quote-stripped, never echoed), then ran `od -c` on the
variable to look for stray quote characters.  `od -c` prints every byte, so the
full key landed in the transcript.  The hook receives the command TEMPLATE
before expansion, so it cannot see the runtime value -- it pattern-matches
structure: a byte-dump tool (od/xxd/hexdump/hd/strings/base64) or `cut -c` in
the same pipeline as `$NAME` / `${NAME}` where NAME looks like a key, or a
last-command `printf %s/%q/%b` of that variable with nothing downstream.  Safe
shape checks stay allowed: `[ -n "$VAR" ]`, `${#VAR}`, `[[ $VAR == *'"'* ]]`.

This is a backstop, not a general secret detector. It cannot see runtime-expanded
shell variable values (the hook receives the command TEMPLATE before execution),
so it can only pattern-match on command STRUCTURE. It does not replace the
secret-safety skill; it enforces the specific failure classes that already
happened.
